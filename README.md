# Tilemap-Editor I am currently working on developing a game: a **2D platformer** made with Pygame. In this game I built a **map editor** that allows players to create their own levels, similar to **Mario Maker**. This makes creating levels both fun and easy. I plan to add even more **tiles** to the editor to further expand its capabilities.  

## Wat is Pygame? Pygame is a **cross-platform** set of **Python** modules designed for writing **video games**. It includes **computer graphics** and **sound libraries** designed to be used with the **Python** programming language.
